        Cloak is a privacy-preserving exit router for Solana that enables anonymous deposits and withdrawals. 
        
        Key Features:
        • Send SOL privately with guaranteed anonymity
        • Zero-knowledge proofs ensure privacy while maintaining security
        • Decentralized proof-of-work mining for sustainable operations
        • Full transparency with open-source protocols
        
        How It Works:
        - Deposit SOL into the shared shield pool
        - Withdraw later without revealing which deposit you own
        - Miners provide proof-of-work claims to unblock withdrawals
        - All transactions verified on-chain using zero-knowledge proofs
        
        Cloak combines cutting-edge cryptography with Solana's high-performance blockchain to deliver privacy-preserving transactions at scale.
